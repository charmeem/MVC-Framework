My path of software learning started around 2012 when my Company's business in Pakistan was on the decline. Forseeing the future of Telecom field where I spent 23 years  I decided to switch career to software development in Septempber 2013.
Opted for self learning, I initialy started from Java ( android development) for very short period of time and later moved to html/css, javascript and jquery.
This brought me to the  path of web development, php and finaly to wordpress. I spent lot of time learning and developing wordpress custom theme and plugins. Then i applied my html/css, JS and Jquery skills to wordpress. Later one friend helped me to learn mvc based php web application. I further consolidated my learning through video courses from udemy, Lynda and tuts+.
I am also maintaining git repositories of my work.
